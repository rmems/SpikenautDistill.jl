Implementation of the Online Spatio-Temporal Trace Training (OTTT) rule.

Calculate gradients for the OTTT learning rule.

This is a placeholder implementation. A real implementation would:
- Maintain presynaptic and postsynaptic traces.
- Compute weight updates based on the correlation between these traces and a global learning signal (loss).
