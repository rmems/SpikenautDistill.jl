    update_eprop!(model, spikes, loss, output; kwargs...)

Calculate eligibility traces and gradients for the e-prop learning rule.

This is a placeholder implementation. A real implementation would involve:
- Maintaining eligibility traces for each synapse.
- Calculating the learning signal based on the loss.
- Computing the gradient as the product of the learning signal and the traces.
- Returning the gradients to be applied by the optimizer in `train_step!`.

    # (e.g., membrane potentials, traces) to perform these calculations.
